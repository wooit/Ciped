# Ciped
The goal here was to build a functional model for a renting bike app. 
It had to be a single page application with an admin page (no CRUD, just the READ functionality).
Details of the projects are listed in the 'Instructions' file.

First time i was using AJAX requests, a relationnal database and JSON files.
This assignment was realised during my summer holidays between the 10th and 17th of August 2020. A few more days were needed after that to correct some mistakes
and make the whole thing more 'readable'.
